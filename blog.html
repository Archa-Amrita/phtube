                    The scope of a variable refers to the region of code in which it is accessible. In JavaScript, there
                    are three types of scopes:
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="text-2xl">Global scope: </span>Variables declared outside of any function are globally
                    scoped, meaning they can be
                    accessed from anywhere in the program.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="text-2xl">Function scope: </span>Variables declared inside a function are function
                    scoped, meaning they can only be
                    accessed from within that function.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="text-2xl">Block scope: </span>Variables declared inside a block of code (such as an if
                    statement, for loop, or curly
                    braces) are block scoped, meaning they can only be accessed from within that block of code.
                    <br><br>
                    var variables have function scope by default, but they can also be globally scoped if declared
                    outside of any function. This can lead to unexpected behavior, so it is generally best to avoid
                    using var variables in favor of let and const variables.
                    <br><br>
                    let variables are block scoped. This means that they can only be accessed from within the block of
                    code in which they are declared. If you try to access a let variable outside of its scope, you will
                    get a reference error.
                    <br><br>
                    const variables are also block scoped, but they cannot be reassigned. Once a const variable is
                    declared, its value cannot be changed. This makes const variables ideal for storing constants, such
                    as the value of pi or the number of days in a year.

                    Null and undefined are two special values in JavaScript that represent the absence of a value.
                    However, there is a subtle difference between the two.
                    <br><br>
                    Null is a value that can be assigned to a variable. It is used to explicitly represent the absence
                    of a value. For example, we might assign null to a variable that represents a user if the user is
                    not logged in.
                    <br><br>
                    Undefined is a value that is assigned to a variable by default if no value is explicitly assigned to
                    it. It is also used to represent the absence of a value, but it is typically used in different
                    situations than null.
                    <br>
                    For example, we might get an undefined value if we try to access a property
                    on an object that does not exist.

                    REST API stands for Representational State Transfer API. It is a type of API that conforms to the
                    REST architectural style. REST is a set of constraints that define how a web service should work.
                    REST APIs are designed to be scalable, efficient, and easy to use.
                    <br><br>
                    REST APIs use HTTP requests to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources.
                    Resources are any identifiable entity, such as a user, product, or order.
                    <br><br>
                    Here are some examples of REST API calls:
                    <br>
                    <span class="text-2xl">GET /users</span> to retrieve a list of all users.
                    <br>
                    <span class="text-2xl">POST /users</span> to create a new user.
                    <br>
                    <span class="text-2xl">PUT /users/{id}</span>  to update a user with the specified ID.
                    <br>
                    <span class="text-2xl">DELETE /users/{id}</span> to delete a user with the specified ID.
                    <br><br>
                    REST APIs are used by a wide variety of applications, including web applications, mobile apps, and
                    desktop softwares.
